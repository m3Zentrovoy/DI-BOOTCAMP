suggestions for improvement:
- The `Currency` class implementation is mostly correct but lacks complete handling of the `__repr__` method and error handling in the addition methods. The `__repr__` should return a string that can be used to recreate the object, which is not the case in the provided code.
- In the addition methods (`__add__` and `__iadd__`), there's a missing check for whether `other` is an instance of `Currency`. If `other` is not an instance of `Currency` or not an integer, it should raise a `TypeError`.  The error messages should also be more informative and consistent.
- The code for exercises 2, 4, and 5 are missing. 
- Exercise 3 uses `random.sample` which is not the most efficient method for generating random strings of a specified length;  Consider using `random.choices` instead.
- In exercise 6, the `parse_birthdate` method should return the total minutes lived, not just the difference in days. The function name should be more descriptive of its function. 
- Improve code commenting and add docstrings to functions for better readability.
