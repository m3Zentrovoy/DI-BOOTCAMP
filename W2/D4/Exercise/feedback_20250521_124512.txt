suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `get_words_from_file` and `get_random_sentence` functions as specified in Exercise 1.  The code currently only has commented-out versions.
- In `main`, improve error handling and user experience by providing more specific and helpful error messages. For example, instead of 'Error: please enter an integer!', say something like 'Invalid input: Please enter a whole number between 2 and 20.'
- Add input validation in `main` to ensure the file exists before attempting to process it.
- In Exercise 2,  the code correctly accesses the nested key, adds a new key, and saves the modified JSON.  However, error handling should be added to manage potential file I/O issues.
- Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., instead of `dictonar`, use `employee_data`).

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only addresses Exercise 2.  Exercise 1, the random sentence generator, is missing entirely.
- Error handling (try-except blocks) is absent in both exercises. The code should include error handling to gracefully manage potential issues like file not found or invalid user input (for Exercise 1).
- Input validation in Exercise 1 is missing.  The code should explicitly check if the user input is an integer and within the specified range (2-20).
- The `main` function (Exercise 1) and the function to read words from the file (Exercise 1) are missing. These are crucial parts of the first exercise.
- The date format in the JSON should be configurable, rather than hardcoded. It would improve flexibility and reusability.
