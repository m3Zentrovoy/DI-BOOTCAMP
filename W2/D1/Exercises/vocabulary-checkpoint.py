# **W2 - OOP - Object-Oriented Programming**

# **Day 1**

# * **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects
# * **Objects**: An instance of a class
#   `cat_1 = Cat('miau', 5)`
# * **Methods**: Functions related to a certain class

# **Day 2**

# * **Inheritance**: A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
#   These classes are called "parent" and "child."
# * **Multiple Inheritance**: A class can inherit from more than one class (two or more parents).
# * **`super()`**: Initializes attributes from the parent class.
# * **Polymorphism**: Using a method with the same name in multiple classes that are related.
# * **`try` and `except` block**: Useful for data validation and preventing internal errors that could crash the code.

# **Day 3**

# * **Decorators**:

#   * @staticmethod`: A method that doesn’t require `self` or `cls`.
#   * @classmethod`: A method that can be called on the class itself (before creating an object).
#   * @property`: A method that behaves like an attribute (you can access the output using dot notation, e.g., `obj1.age`).

# * **Dunder Methods**: Short for “double underscore,” also called "magic methods."

#   * `__init__(self)`
#   * `__str__(self)`
#   * `__repr__(self)`
#   * `__lt__(self)`
#   * `__eq__(self)`

# These methods are triggered automatically, often through math or comparison operations.
